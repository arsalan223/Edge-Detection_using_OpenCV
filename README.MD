# Edge-Detection_using_OpenCV

The program will detect edges in given image/video using Canny Edge Detection Method comes with OpenCV.

## 1) Edge Detector for Images:
works on images, threshold values can be manipulated via sliders.

## 2) Edge Detector for Video/Webcam:
Works on Webcam footage or Video files, window will close on pressing 'q'.

## 3) Edge Detector for Video/Webcam (with Sliders):
This one is for testing and setting the desired values for thresholds.
Threshold values can be manipulated via sliders.

### About Canny Edge Detector:
The Canny edge detection algorithm based on 5 steps: (which are out of my level of Abstraction)

* Noise reduction. (Gaussian Blur)
* Gradient calculation.
* Non-maximum suppression.
* Double threshold.
* Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.
