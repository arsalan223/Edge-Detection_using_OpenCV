# Edge-Detection_using_OpenCV

The program will detect edges in given image using Canny Edge Detection Method comes with OpenCV.

The Canny edge detection algorithm based on 5 steps: (which are out of my level of Abstraction)

* Noise reduction.
* Gradient calculation.
* Non-maximum suppression.
* Double threshold.
* Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.
