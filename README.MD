# Edge-Detection_using_OpenCV

The program will detect edges in given image using Canny Edge Detection Method comes with OpenCV.

The Canny edge detection algorithm based on 5 steps: (which are out of my level of Abstraction)

*Noise reduction.
*Gradient calculation.
*Non-maximum suppression.
*Double threshold.
*Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.
